# CrazyAllenDataScience
Hello, everyone! This is __Crazy Allen__. I am an enthusiastic learner of machine learning and deep learning. In my Github, I will share my notebooks of learning data science, and some good resources that help me a lot. Also, I think that's a perfect place to record what I have done and what I want to complete. I am a beginner, as well as a striver. 

Learning never ends.

__Learning Resources__:
- Youtube: [Python Tutorials by Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU). I found Corey's Tutorials very useful. His explanation is detailed and easy to understand.
- Book: [Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-2nd-Edition/dp/1593279280/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=Python&qid=1574135537&s=books&sr=1-4)
- Web: [W3school](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp), [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)

### 1.2 Python Data Analysis
- [Pandas](https://github.com/allen1881996/CrazyAllenDataScience/tree/master/Python/Libraries/Pandas): I have learned Pandas using [Python-Data-Science-Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Science-Handbook-Essential/dp/1491912057/ref=sr_1_3?crid=BQ8SPZ8S88SV&keywords=python+data+science+handbook&qid=1574349439&sprefix=Python+data%2Caps%2C138&sr=8-3). I strongly suggest [Jake Vanderplas's Github](https://github.com/allen1881996/PythonDataScienceHandbook), which includes this handbook in the form of Jupyter Notebook. I also use these notebooks to learn and would love to share my summary and notes. In addition, using [Guilherme Samora's Pandas exercises](https://github.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises) is a good way to train your Pandas skills. What's more, [sentex's tutorial of Data Analysis using Pandas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLw1RNvfElg&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfSfqQuee6K8opKtZsh7sA9) can help you quickly learn how to analysis data with Pandas. I have uploaded my codes and notes of his tutorial.    
- Numpy
- [Matplotlib](https://github.com/allen1881996/CrazyAllenDataScience/tree/master/Python/Data%20Analysis/Matplotlib): Again, the best Youtube channel in my mind, [Corey Schafer's tutorial of Matplotlib](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO98lJQ3QGI&list=PL-osiE80TeTvipOqomVEeZ1HRrcEvtZB_) includes the basic of Matplotlib. I have made a IPython form of his tutorial with my notes. 
- [Web Scraping](https://github.com/allen1881996/CrazyAllenDataScience/tree/master/Python/Libraries/Web%20Scraping)

## 2. Deep Learning
- [Build Neural Networks with Pytorch](https://github.com/allen1881996/CrazyAllenDataScience/tree/master/Deep%20Learning/Build%20Neural%20Networks%20with%20Pytorch): This notebook is for [sentdex's tutorial of Pytorch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDdeMyHEYc0gxFpYwHY2Qfdh), which is a great 
- [Tensorflow in Practice](https://github.com/allen1881996/CrazyAllenDataScience/tree/master/Deep%20Learning/TensorFlow%20in%20Practice): This part include my notebook of Coursera's Tensorflow in Practice Specialization. It's a quick guide of Tensorflow 2.0 and including: Neural Network, Computer Vision, NLP, and Sequence Model.

## 3. Projects
- [Time Series Analysis of Sunspots](https://github.com/allen1881996/CrazyAllenDataScience/blob/master/Project/time-series-analysis-of-sunspots.ipynb): Predicted the monthly sunspot number based on the dataset that contains monthly mean sunspot numbers from 1749 to 2018. Built multiple models including Naive Forecast, Moving Average Forecast, SARIMA Forecast, Simple DNN Forecast, and RNN Forecast. Finally got a mean absolute error of 17.645.
- [Convolutional Neural Network for Natural Images Classification](https://github.com/allen1881996/CrazyAllenDataScience/blob/master/Project/cnn-for-natural-images-classification.ipynb): Classified a nature images dataset of 6899 images from 8 distinct classes with 90% out-of-sample accuracy. Built a 2-D convolutional neural network with 3 convolutional layers and 2 linear layers using Pytorch.
